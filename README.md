# MACD-trading-algorithm
A Python program that allows the user to input a stock ticker, date, and investment amount to predict returns based on the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) method.


MACD is a trend-following indicator that demonstrates the relationship between the moving averages of a security’s price. MACD triggers signals when it crosses above or below its signal line, giving indication to buy or sell. MACD helps traders understand when the recent change in a stock’s price may signal a change in its underlying trend. This can help traders decide when to enter, increase, or exit an investment position.
